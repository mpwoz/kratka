# Notes

Anything that comes up during development, not really intended for consumers of the package but others may find it helpful.


## General

- I'm attempting to use `cargo smart-release` to release multiple crates from a single workspace: https://crates.io/crates/cargo-smart-release


## Publishing Libraries

- Publishing crates to crates.io https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/publishing.html
- Semver examples https://regex101.com/r/Ly7O1x/3/


## Grid system reading

- Draw fewer tiles - by using a Dual-Grid system! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEWFSv3ivTg
- Deepnight grid-based games with smooth movement https://deepnight.net/tutorial/a-simple-platformer-engine-part-1-basics/


## Todo

- [ ] Read and understand the publishing API guidelines https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/
- [ ] Set up a github pages landing page
- [ ] Make sure rustdoc is working
